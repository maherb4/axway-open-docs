## Summary

API Gateway is available as a software installation or a virtualized deployment in Docker containers. API Manager is a licensed product running on top of API Gateway, and has the same deployment options as API Gateway.

The software installation is available on Linux. For more details on supported platforms for software installation, see [System requirements](/docs/apim_installation/apigtw_install/system_requirements/).

Docker deployment is supported on Linux. For a summary of the system requirements for a Docker deployment, see [Set up Docker environment](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_containers/docker_scripts_prereqs/).

## New features and enhancements

The following new features and enhancements are available in this update.

### Casandra backup and restore automated script

An easy and convenient automated script to backup and restore Cassandra clusters are now included in API Manager. The script will also be available, separately, for customers in supported versions prior to November 2020. For more information, see [Apache Cassandra backup and restore](/docs/cass_admin/cassandra_bur).

### Enhanced API life cycle management for Organization administrators

In the [September 2020](/docs/apim_relnotes/20200930_apimgr_relnotes/#organization-administrators-can-publish-apis) release, we created the `api.manager.orgadmin.selfservice.enabled` system property to allow an Organization administrator to publish and unpublish APIs that were created in their organization without approval from an API Administrator.

In this release, we enhanced the property with new API life cycle events (deprecate, undeprecate, upgrade, and grant access to APIs), which will be made available to an Organization administrator when `api.manager.orgadmin.selfservice.enabled` is set to True.

For more information, see [System property changes](/docs/apim_reference/system_props/).

### Policy Studio help documentation

This update includes changes to the Policy Studio documentation, but the version of the documentation (Eclipse Help) shipped with Policy Studio is out of sync with the online documentation and does not include these changes.

We are working to rectify this issue in a future update. In the meantime, you can find the up to date documentation online at [Develop in Policy Studio](/docs/apim_policydev/).

## Update a classic (non-container) deployment

To update your API Gateway, see [Update from API Gateway One Version](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_upgrade/upgrade_steps_oneversion/).

To upgrade from an older version of the product, see [Upgrade from API Gateway 7.5.x or 7.6.x](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_upgrade/upgrade_steps_extcass/).

## Update a container deployment

Any custom `fed` files deployed to a container must be upgraded using [upgradeconfig](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_upgrade/upgrade_analytics#upgradeconfig-options) or [projupgrade](/docs/apim_reference/devopstools_ref#projupgrade-command-options). They must be upgraded the same way, regardless of whether they are API Manager enabled or not.

The `fed` now contains the updates for the API Manager configuration and can be used to build containers.
